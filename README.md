# CS 320 Portfolio Reflection

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I ensure my software is functional and secure by applying thorough unit testing and validation throughout development. In Project One, I used JUnit tests to verify that the contact service correctly enforced constraints such as required fields, length limits, and immutability of contact IDs. Writing both positive and negative test cases helped uncover potential defects early and ensured the program behaved as expected under normal and edge-case conditions. Automated testing also improves security by reducing logical errors that could be exploited and by ensuring consistent behavior as the code evolves.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret user needs by carefully analyzing requirements and translating them into clear functional rules within the code. For example, the contact service requirements specified what data fields were required, which values could not be null, and what operations were allowed. I incorporated these needs directly into the program logic and validated them through test cases that mirrored real user scenarios. This approach ensures that the software meets expectations while preventing invalid or unsafe input from being accepted.

How do I approach designing software?

I approach software design by breaking the problem into manageable components and focusing on maintainability and testability. In these projects, I separated responsibilities between data models, service logic, and test classes, which made the code easier to understand and extend. I also designed the software with testing in mind, ensuring that each method could be independently verified through unit tests. This structured approach improves code quality, supports automation, and aligns with best practices in software testing and quality assurance.
